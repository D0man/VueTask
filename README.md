# Simple recruitment task
 I was ask to made simple to do up in Vue. The idea is to make 3 buttons that adds task, removing last task and clearing all task. 
## Live version
[VueTask](https://d0man.github.io/VueTask/)
##File mangament
I didn't bother creating additinal folders for my app i just created index.html via vue-cli simple and add css file.
##main.css
I didn't sass or autoprefixer cuz app is very small, it should work on modern browsers but in older it can have some problems with flex. I didn't use any normalizer or more specyfic reset(usaly i do);
##index.html
I didn't bother with creating js file cuz this way is "more vue", usually i work with webpack and use templates in vue file to create components. Also i didnt add meta tags etc.
##javascript
JavaScript is writen in es6 so it could not work in older browsers, again usually webpack and babel takes care for me in this
