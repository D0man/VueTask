# Simple recruitment task
 I was ask to made simple to do up in Vue. The idea is to make 3 buttons that adds task, removing last task and clearing all task. 
## Live version
[VueTask](https://d0man.github.io/VueTask/)
## File mangament
I didn't bother creating additinal folders for my app i just created index.html via vue-cli simple and add css file.
## css
I usually write my apps with sass and post-css to add prefixes, but this app is simple so decided to not doing this. Still i used flex without prefixes so it can be buged on older browsers

## javascript
JavaScript is writen in es6 so it could not work in older browsers
